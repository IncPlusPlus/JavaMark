### Purpose
This project was a random idea I came up with and now it became much larger than I had thought it could.

### How to run
If you are running this the correct way. You are guaranteed to run into a `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError` exception. To avoid this, ensure you have at least 2GB of ram available and run the software with `java -Xmx2g JavaMark`. If you have more memory available, feel free to give it to the program by changing the number in the parameter to your liking. The format is as follows: `java -XmxRAMg` and replacing 'RAM' with the available memory you will give the program.



### To Do
- [x] Implement [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes)
- [ ] Implement lossy pi calc
- [ ] ~Implement [Lucasâ€“Lehmer primality test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas%E2%80%93Lehmer_primality_test)~
- [ ] Add [Guava](https://github.com/google/guava)'s [Stopwatch class](http://google.github.io/guava/releases/22.0/api/docs/com/google/common/base/Stopwatch.html) for timing function calls





Notes for later:

Uses Guava for timing
