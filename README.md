# PiMark
PiMark is a utility that performs a benchmark of a CPU by calculating pi. The calculation uses a converging series created by [Srinivasa Ramanujan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinivasa_Ramanujan) (seen [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximations_of_%CF%80#20th_century))which more accurately calculates digits of pi as the term number of the series is increased.
